# UNISA HPCOS81 2019

My notes and study material for the prerequsitie research course for UNISA's honour's project.

The aim of this module to generate the research proposal for the project you will work on in your second year.

The topic for this year is **Ethical Computing.**

Ethical Computing is a broad topic that includes a wide range of interesting viewpoints, research areas and discussion points. You can decide what specific scope within Ethical Computing you want to focus on and do your research proposal in.

Some examples:

* Software programming within an ethical environment
* Ethical interactions within social media for school learners
* Ensuring ethical computing amongst end users within industry
* Ethical use within Social Media \(Facebook\)
* Cyber Safety dependent on ethical actions
