### Referencing

Ensure that all content is correctly referenced and cited within any submitted work that refers or builds upon another authors work. This includes both printed and online resources.

References should be accurately tracked throughout the research process. Use a citation manager to ensure the accuracy of your references and to ease the burden of maintaining references.

#### Some of the common terms that will be found while working with references and academic research in general:

**Citation**: Identifies the source within the body of the document. Usually includes the author and the publication year.

**References:** All the publications your refer to in your document. This will include all your citations.

**Bibliography:** Sources that were read, but not necessarily cited \(includes background reading\).

**List of references/reference list:** Includes only the sources that you referred to \(cited\) within the text of your dissertation/thesis. It contains full details of all the in-text citations

**Reading list:** Required reading material for a course.

**In-text referencing/citing: **When the author inserts, at the appropriate places in the work, the surname of the person whose original information has been cited and the year of that publication.

**Literature review:** A literature review reviews the critical points of current knowledge and or methodological approaches on the subject. No new or original experimental work should be included. An extensive search of the information pertaining to a specific field or body of knowledge or topic which results in a list of references to books, periodicals, and other materials on the topic. It provides an overview and critical analysis of relevant published scholarly articles, research reports, books, theses etc on the topic or issue to be investigated. A systematic and exhaustive search for published material on a specific topic.

**Digital Object Identifier \(DOI\):** A unique alpha-numeric string assigned by a registration agency to identify content and to provide a consistent link to its location on the Internet.
